                  <h4>2. YOUR STATUS</h4>
                  <p>
                    By placing an order for Products on the Platform, you
                    warrant that you have the legal ability to enter into a
                    binding contract with the Partner for the purchase of
                    Products, and you are at least 18 years old. You also
                    confirm that you are using the Services for personal,
                    non-commercial use.
                  </p>
                  <h4>3. OUR SERVICES AND ROLE</h4>
                  <p>
                    We provide you with a way to order Products from our
                    Partners using the Platform (the "Services"). We act as an
                    agent on behalf of the Partner to complete the order for
                    Products from the Platform and to offer updates and other
                    communications during the ordering process. Your Products
                    will be delivered by our delivery personnel and/or our
                    Partners, to the address provided by you when ordering. The
                    legal contract for the purchase of Products from the Partner
                    is between you and the Partner.
                    <br />
                    We will endeavour to make the Platforms available 24 hours a
                    day, however we do not undertake any obligation to do so,
                    and we will not be liable to you if the Platform is
                    unavailable at any time or period. You acknowledge that we
                    will carry out maintenance on the Platforms from time to
                    time, and the Platforms may have limited or no availability
                    during these times.
                    <br />
                    The Services in respect of certain Partners may not be
                    available in your area. Each Partner has their own operating
                    area and opening hours, which are within their control and
                    at their discretion. This means our Service availability and
                    range of Partners available to you is dependent on the
                    operating hours of our Partners, and your location. Our
                    Services are only available in Northern Ireland and the
                    Republic of Ireland.
                    <br />
                    If you attempt to order Products to a location outside the
                    delivery area or operating hours of a Partner, or the
                    Platform is otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will
                    notify you.
                  </p>
                  <h4>4. OPENING A ROADRUNNER ACCOUNT</h4>
                  <p>
                    You will need to create a Roadrunner account with us before
                    you can order Products on the Platform. When you open a
                    Roadrunner account you will be asked to provide your
                    personal details including name, address, date of birth,
                    credit card details and you will be asked to create a unique
                    password to access your account. You will be responsible for
                    entering this data accurately, and for keeping any password
                    you create secret, and prevent others from accessing your
                    account. Your personal details will be processed by us in
                    accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                    <br />
                    We are not responsible for any losses you suffer as a result
                    of an unauthorised person accessing your account, unless the
                    reason for the unauthorised access is due to us not keeping
                    your account secure.
                  </p>
                  <h4>5. ORDERING PROCESS</h4>
                  <p>
                    It is important that you check the Products you have ordered
                    and correct any errors before submitting your order, as once
                    you do so, you will have entered into a contract with the
                    Partner, and any errors cannot be corrected (subject to
                    clause 10 below).
                    <br />
                    You will be asked to select your payment method. Payment
                    will be taken via our third party payment operator, Stripe,
                    Inc. (Stripe). Where the payment method you have selected is
                    not authorised, your order will not be confirmed or sent to
                    the Partner.
                    <br />
                    Once payment is authorised by Stripe, we will send your
                    order to the Partner, and notify you on the Platform that
                    your order has been received and is being processed by the
                    Partner ("Confirmation"). The contract between you and the
                    Partner for the supply of the Products to you comes into
                    existence when we send you the Confirmation. Please note
                    that a Confirmation does not necessarily mean the order will
                    be fulfilled by the Partner. The Partner has the ability to
                    reject orders at any time, for example, because they are too
                    busy. We will notify you as soon as reasonably practicable
                    by email or on the Platform if a Partner has rejected an
                    order. Please see clause 10 for the process on rejected
                    orders.
                    <br />
                    You are responsible for:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>paying for all Products ordered using your account;</li>
                    <li>paying related delivery charges, and</li>
                    <li>
                      complying with these Terms, even if you have ordered on
                      behalf of someone else.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  You acknowledge that some Partners operate a minimum order
                  value policy and this will be notified to you on the Platform.
                  All Products are subject to availability.
                  <p />
                  <h4>6. FOOD ALLERGIES AND INTOLERANCES</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our Partners have an obligation to provide us with
                    up-to-date information in respect of menus. We will include
                    this on the Platforms. Where this information includes
                    allergy or dietary information, we will use reasonable
                    endeavours to accurately display this information on our
                    Platforms.
                    <br />
                    If you have a food allergy or intolerance, you acknowledge
                    that it is your responsibility to check that the Products
                    are suitable for you, and to notify the Partner of any food
                    allergy or intolerance before placing an order for Products.
                    You should always contact the Partner directly, and you
                    should not use the Platform for this purpose.
                    <br />
                    We cannot guarantee that any of the Products sold by our
                    Partners are free from allergens. We shall not be liable for
                    any claim for direct, indirect, special or consequential
                    loss or damage to you or anyone else arising from any
                    inaccurate information provided to us by the Partner and/or
                    displayed on our Platform in relation to allergies or
                    dietary requirements, and/or the act, omission or negligence
                    of the Partner in relation to allergies or dietary
                    requirements.
                  </p>
                  <h4>7. ALCOHOL</h4>
                  <p>
                    You acknowledge that it is an offence for a person under the
                    age of 18 to buy or attempt to buy alcohol, or for a person
                    over 18 to buy or attempt to buy alcohol for someone who is
                    under the age of 18.
                    <br />
                    If the Products you have ordered include alcohol, you are
                    confirming that you are at least 18 years old. You will be
                    asked to provide proof of age on delivery of your order.
                    Roadrunner operates the "Challenge 25" age verification
                    policy which means customers who look under 25 will be asked
                    by our delivery personnel to provide proof that they are
                    aged 18 or over. Our delivery personnel may refuse to
                    deliver any alcohol to any person [who does not look 25]
                    unless they can provide valid photo ID proving that they are
                    aged 18 or over. The Partner and the delivery personnel may
                    also refuse to deliver any alcohol to any person who they
                    believe is buying alcohol on behalf of someone who is under
                    the age of 18, or who is, or appears to be, under the
                    influence of either alcohol and/or drugs. If delivery of
                    alcohol is refused for any reason, you will still be charged
                    for the Products and delivery.
                  </p>
                  <h4>8. PARTNER OFFERS</h4>
                  <p>
                    Partners can make special offers available through the
                    Platform, at their discretion which will be set out on their
                    menu. Offers can be withdrawn at any time, unless you have
                    received a Confirmation or the offer terms state a fixed
                    period of availability.
                  </p>
                  <h4>9. DELIVERY PROCESS</h4>
                  <p>
                    When you place an order you will have the choice to have it
                    placed for delivery 'now' or at a specified time. For a
                    delivery 'now' we will tell you an estimated delivery time
                    for your Products before you place the order but you must be
                    available to accept delivery from the time you place the
                    order.
                    <br />
                    For delivery at a specified time, we will give you an
                    estimated delivery time, and you must be available to accept
                    delivery for [1 hour] before and after the time.
                    <br />
                    Estimated times for deliveries are only estimates, and we
                    and our Partners cannot guarantee that orders will be
                    delivered on time. If your order is more than 1 hour late
                    and this is not due to a Customer Fault (defined below) we
                    will notify you, and give you the option to cancel your
                    order. If you choose cancel your order in these
                    circumstances, you will receive a refund for the Products in
                    accordance with clause 10.
                    <br />
                    We will attempt delivery at the address you provide on the
                    Platform when you place your order. You are responsible for
                    entering this accurately. You can change the delivery
                    address after the order has been placed by ringing the
                    restaurant if the order has not been dispatched and if the
                    new address is in the Partner's delivery area. If we cannot
                    change the delivery address, you have the option to cancel
                    the order, but if food preparation has started you will be
                    charged the full price for the Products, and if the driver
                    has been despatched you will also be charged for delivery.
                    <br />
                    You will still be charged for the Products and for delivery
                    in the event that a delivery cannot be completed because of
                    circumstances caused by you ("Customer Fault"). A Customer
                    Fault might be caused by the following reasons (including
                    but not limited to):
                    <br />
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You do not come to the door to accept delivery;</li>

                      The driver is unable to find a safe location to leave the
                      food;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You provided a misleading, confusing or ambiguous delivery
                      address;

                    <li>You provided an incorrect delivery address;</li>
                    <li>
                      The driver refuses to deliver the Products to you in
                      accordance with clause 7 (Alcohol), or if your behaviour
                      is intimidating, rude, violent or aggressive;
                    </li>
                    <li>You cancelled the order after dispatch.</li>

                  <p />
                  <h4>10. CANCELLATION</h4>
                  <p>
                    Once an order for Products has been submitted and your
                    payment method has been authorised, you will not be able to
                    change or cancel your order, or be entitled to a refund
                    (subject to clause 11 below). If you wish to cancel your
                    order, you can contact our customer care team on 07716137341
                    and we will attempt to contact the Partner to amend or
                    cancel your order as requested. However, we cannot guarantee
                    that we will be able to make contact with the Partner, or
                    that the Partner will be able to comply with your request.
                    <br />
                    If you cancel an order after the Partner has started to
                    prepare it, you will be charged full price for the Products,
                    and if our delivery personnel have already left to begin
                    delivery, you will also be charged for delivery, together
                    with any applicable Service Fees.
                    <br />
                    Partners may reject an order at any time, for example, if
                    they are too busy, as set out at paragraph 5. We and the
                    Partner may notify you that an order has been rejected at
                    any time. You will not be charged for any orders rejected by
                    us or the Partner, and we will reimburse you for any payment
                    already made using the same method you used to pay for your
                    order. Because of banking procedures, a refund may take 3 to
                    5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card
                    issuer) to appear in your account, as set out at clause 11
                    below). You acknowledge and agree that neither we or our
                    Partner are liable to you in respect of any delay by your
                    bank or card issuer to release funds back into your account.
                  </p>
                  <h4>11. PRICES AND PAYMENT</h4>
                  <p>
                    Payment for all Products and deliveries can be made on our
                    Platform by credit or debit card or cash when applicable.
                    Where the option to pay by cash is available, this will be
                    made clear to you on our Platform before you place your
                    order. Online payment will be taken by Stripe, and is made
                    directly to Roadrunner as agent on behalf of the Partner. We
                    are authorised by the Partners to accept payment on their
                    behalf in this way. Once you place your order and your
                    payment has been authorised by Stripe, your bank or card
                    issuer will allocate the full amount of your order for
                    payment for 3 to 5 working days (or more, depending on your
                    bank or card issuer). The amount for the order which has
                    been allocated will not appear in your available balance
                    during that period. Payment will be debited from your
                    account or charged to your card when funds are received by
                    us from your bank or card issuer. Sometimes payment can take
                    up to sixty (60) days to be debited from your account or
                    charged to your credit card, due to delays in processing, or
                    depending on your card issuer or bank. If the order is
                    rejected by the Partner in accordance with clause 9, the
                    allocated amount will be released back into your account as
                    a refund, which may take 3 to 5 working days (or longer,
                    depending on your bank or card issuer) to appear in your
                    account. You acknowledge that we, nor the Partner, are
                    liable for any delay by your bank or card issuer to release
                    funds to us, or release refunds back into your account.
                    <br />

                    inclusive of VAT but exclude delivery costs and any service
                    fees we may charge ("Service Fees"). These will be notified
                    to you and added to the total amount prior to purchase, if
                    applicable. We reserve the right to change the Service Fees
                    at any time. Total price of your order will be set out at

                    browsing the Platform, and may also change at any time at
                    the discretion of the Partner. Price changes will not affect
                    existing confirmed orders or any orders in progress provided
                    you complete the order within 2 hours of starting it.
                    <br />
                    If you make payment online via debit or credit card, you may
                    be asked to produce the debit or credit card at the time of
                    delivery of the Products to you, as proof of identity.The
                    Platform contains a large number of menus, and there is a
                    possibility that some of the menus may include incorrect
                    pricing. If there is an obvious pricing mistake we will
                    notify you as soon as we can and you can either confirm the
                    order at the correct price or cancel the order without
                    charge and a full refund of any amounts paid.

                    discretion if we have reasonable cause to believe you are
                    abusing your use of the Services, for example, continually
                    making unreasonable complaints, continually attempting to
                    cancel orders, seeking refunds which you are not entitled
                    to, mistreating our staff, or any other reason. If we close
                    your account permanently we will refund any remaining
                    account credit you have validly obtained from our customer
                    care team.
